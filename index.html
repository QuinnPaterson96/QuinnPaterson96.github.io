        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Quinn! I'm a passionate software developer with extensive experience in test automation and embedded development, 
            as well as some hands-on experience in AI, web development, app development, and more. 
            I'm currently open to opportunities that allow me to apply my skills, as well as those that encourage me to grow in new areas.</p>

            <h3>Project: Spontaniius</h3>
            <p>Spontaniius is an app designed to facilitate impromptu meetups, allowing users to quickly create events and broadcast them to others nearby. 
                This was my first attempt at building a complete application with entrepreneurial potential. 
                After testing with a few users, I found that scaling it would be challenging, especially with my move to a new city. 
                Ultimately, I decided to retire the project, but it was a valuable learning experience.</p>

            <h3>Project: Reformer tabletop game</h3>
            <p>
                while working on a tabletop game recently I thought it might be nice to use html to try and 
                demo out some looks for the playing cards of the game. I'd already used excel for designing the cards,
                 so why not plug that into html. And so I did, links below
