                    Hi, I'm Quinn! I'm a software developer passionate about solving real-world problems 
                    in areas like medical technology, construction, finance, logistics, and beyond. 
                    I bring extensive experience in test automation and embedded development, 
                    with additional hands-on knowledge in AI, web development, and app development. 
                    I'm eager to tackle your toughest challenges and contribute to meaningful solutions.

                        Spontaniius is an app designed to facilitate impromptu meetups, allowing users to quickly create events and broadcast them to others nearby. 
                        This was my first attempt at building a complete application with entrepreneurial potential. 
                        After testing with a few users, I found that scaling it would be challenging, especially with my move to a new city. 
                        Ultimately, I decided to retire the project, but it was a valuable learning experience.

                    <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
                        While working on a tabletop game recently, I thought it might be nice to use HTML to try and 
                        demo out some looks for the playing cards of the game. I'd used Excel for designing the cards and had the realization 
                        that HTML and JavaScript could be used to quickly get an idea of what they would look like, in addition to providing me something to
                        print (and that could also therefore be used to easily iterate on cards as I got more feedback).
                        
                        An example of what this looks like:
